## Text Embeddings
This repository contains code based upon the Odden et. al paper and the G.E.V.I.R repository.
Only the code is included here (no data) for privacy and security reasons.

This code focuses on three goals:

1) Cleaning and aligning data with the proper format.

2) Analyzing text embeddings.

3) Assigning new codes to uncoded data.

Many functions and workflows at this point in time are specific to the data and
way it is organized locally, so functions and code *will* need adjustment.

**Code is a work in progress.**
